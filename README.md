# Kiri
A simple and fast fuzzy finder inspired by fzy with a fancier UI.

It uses the same algorithm as fzy.

# Notes:
- This project may have problems, it's still under development
- PRs are likely welcome :)
- I still think fzf's algorithm is 10 times better than this one (and than fzy's)
- Hyprland is for femboys

# Installation:
From source:
```
git clone https://github.com/yukiisen/kiri.git
cd kiri
make
cp ./build/kiri ~/.local/bin/kiri // or somewhere else
```

# Usage:
It is quite similar to any other fuzzy finder so there's no need for this section

Check [fzy](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy) for more information.
